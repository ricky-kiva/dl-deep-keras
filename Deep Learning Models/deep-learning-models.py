### SHALLOW VS. DEEP NEURAL NETWORK

# Shallow Neural Network has small number of hidden layers (such as only 1)
# Deep Neural Network has large number of neurons & hidden layers

# why Deep Learning Took off?
# - advancement in the field itself (such ReLU)
# - data (widely available)
# - computational power (like nVidia GPUs, offers training of large data in the matter of hours/day)
